##About
Hummingsync is free and open source, and uses the [Ionic Framework](ionicframework.com).
It also uses Material Design components from [Ionic Material](ionicmaterial.com) and [Materialize](materializecss.com).
It utilizes the Hummingbird API on Mashape, and is currently only optimized for phones with a screen size of around 5 inches. It should still work on smaller/larger devices, but it might not be particularly pretty.
